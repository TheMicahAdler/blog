## Welcome

Hi! I’m Micah. This blog is for sharing my work on **mechanistic interpretability**.

**My approach to research:** First and foremost, I love to collaborate.  If you have similar interests, are curious about anything I've written, or are working on a problem you think I might be interested in, please reach out.  My background is in theoretical computer science, so I tend to take a "theory first" approach to research, but I also think it is important to follow that up with real experiments.  I'm interested in all things Mech Interp, but also AI more broadly.

**My approach to this blog:** I like to share a bit more polished work here - work that has already been written up at least somewhat formally, and shared publically elsewhere.  I have several projects in process - happy to discuss so please reach out!

**Other research:** If you’re interested in my broader research outside mechanistic interpretability, check out the [full list of my publications](other-research.qmd).
