  This work proposes combinatorial interpretability: understanding neural computation by analyzing combinatorial structure in the sign patterns of weights and biases. The authors introduce feature-channel coding, where features are encoded across groups of neurons; overlapping channels naturally yield polysemanticity and interference. Using only static analysis of weight matrices—no activation tracing or auxiliary autoencoders—they provide complete mechanistic interpretations of several small, gradient-trained networks. The framework reframes the superposition hypothesis in a way that proposes a mechanism for computation, beyond the usual representation aspect of the hypothesis.  It also uses the combinatorial interpretability framework to explain a scaling law.
