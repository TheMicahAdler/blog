  This work proposes combinatorial interpretability: understanding neural computation by analyzing combinatorial structure in the sign patterns of weights and biases. The authors introduce feature-channel coding, where features are encoded across groups of neurons; overlapping channels naturally yield polysemanticity and interference. Using only static analysis of weight matrices—no activation tracing or auxiliary autoencoders—they provide complete mechanistic interpretations of several small, gradient-trained networks. The framework reframes the superposition hypothesis in a way that proposes a mechanism for computation, beyond the usual representation aspect of the hypothesis.  It also gives an exact link between parameter count and the class of Boolean features that can be computed with low error. While demonstrated on Boolean functions, the approach may extend to broader neural networks.
